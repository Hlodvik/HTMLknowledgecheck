I began learning html and css about 18 years ago when I was using myspace. began learning javascript maybe 10 years ago, though I'd not like to imply that it's something
I've used on a daily basis. Still, with the help from vscode extensions, all I really needed to look up was suggestions on margins and padding. I will say I got more used 
to using tools like what squarespace and other DIY website kits offer, but even using those tools you're better off knowing how to script. I'm more than happy with the
way it looks all for work of a single day.  

website functionality:
    a style sheet with css rules that look pretty darn good if I do say so myself. all of the styling choices remain consistant across the pages.

    sticky navbar with functional links
    
    a ROBUST *Lorem Ipsum* about us

    the contact form with all of the requested functionalities.

    a table of products, gathered info from google, including the prices and descriptions.

    Images using the placeholder 200x300 images and two more from google. did one with the inline style rounded border.  I felt like making the pictures links, 
    so I did that as well.
